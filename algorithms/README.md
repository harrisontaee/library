# Algorithms

A collection of algorithm subcategories. Within each subcategory, algorithms are contained within their own directories. Each algorithm directory contains a README.md file that includes a description, visualisation and time complexity diagram of the respective algorithm along with multiple ```<ext>.<ext>``` files where ```<ext>``` is the file extension of the language the code is written in.
