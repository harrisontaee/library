# Algorithms

A collection of algorithm subcategories. Within each subcategory, algorithms are contained within their own directories. Each algorithm directory contains multiple ```<ext>.<ext>``` files where ```<ext>``` is the file extension of the language the code is written in along with a README.md file that includes a description, visualisation and time/space complexity table.
