# Heap

A Heap is a binary tree data structure where the relationship between parent and child nodes is always logically consistent. For example in a "Max Heap", a given parent is always greater than its children. A heap is stored as an array where each item represents a node. In the context of a binary tree, items in the array from left to right read level by level from left to right (where level is the tree depth).
