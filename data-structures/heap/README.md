# Heap

A Heap is a binary tree data structure where the relationship between parent and child nodes is always logically consistent. For example in a "Max Heap", a parent is always greater than its children. Heaps are stored as arrays where each node is an item in the array. In the context of a binary tree, the array from left to right reads level by level from left to right. (Level being the depth of the tree, starting at 0).
